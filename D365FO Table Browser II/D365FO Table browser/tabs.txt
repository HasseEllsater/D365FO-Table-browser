We don't have an existing example/sample (though @ukandrewc might). For WinForms the APIs should be the same though:
webView2.CoreWebView2.NewWindowRequested += ...
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.web.webview2.core.corewebview2.newwindowrequested?view=webview2-dotnet-1.0.705.50

and you would set the NewWindow in the event handler:
args.NewWindow = myTab.myWebView2;

@Dave-Jalpan You need to wait for for CoreWebView2 to initialize before you can use it.

I don't have a C++ example but here's the skeleton of what you need to do:
You don't need to set the source of the new tab, CoreWebView2 will do that after the deferral is complete.

Public MyWebView2: Inherits WebView2

'Need these to defer NewWindowRequested
Friend Deferral As CoreWebView2Deferral
Friend EventArgs As CoreWebView2NewWindowRequestedEventArgs

Private Sub WVBrowser_CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted(sender As Object, e As CoreWebView2InitializationCompletedEventArgs) Handles Me.CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted
	If e.IsSuccess Then
		'Was deferral set in previous instance?
		If Deferral IsNot Nothing Then
			'Set this instance, complete NewWindowRequested and clear deferral
			EventArgs.NewWindow = Me.CoreWebView2
			Deferral.Complete()
			Deferral = Nothing
			EventArgs = Nothing
		End If
End Sub

Private Sub CoreWeb_NewWindowRequested(sender As Object, e As CoreWebView2NewWindowRequestedEventArgs) Handles CoreWeb.NewWindowRequested
	'Create an instance and defer until CoreWebView2 ready
	Dim Browser As New MyWebView2
	Browser.Deferral = e.GetDeferral
	Browser.EventArgs = e
End Sub



internal partial class SurroundingClass
{
    public object MyWebView2;

    class _failedMemberConversionMarker1
    {
    }

    // Need these to defer NewWindowRequested
    internal CoreWebView2Deferral Deferral;
    internal CoreWebView2NewWindowRequestedEventArgs EventArgs;

    public SurroundingClass()
    {
        this.CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted += WVBrowser_CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted;
    }

    private void WVBrowser_CoreWebView2InitializationCompleted(object sender, CoreWebView2InitializationCompletedEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.IsSuccess)
        {
            // Was deferral set in previous instance?
            if (Deferral is not null)
            {
                // Set this instance, complete NewWindowRequested and clear deferral
                EventArgs.NewWindow = this.CoreWebView2;
                Deferral.Complete();
                Deferral = null;
                EventArgs = null;
            }
        }
    }
}
